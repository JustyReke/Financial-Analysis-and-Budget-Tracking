# Financial and Budget Analysis 

## Project Overview

In today’s competitive business landscape, financial efficiency is critical to the success and sustainability of any organization—particularly for consultancy firms that manage diverse projects across various departments. This project focuses on the financial analysis and budget tracking of a consultancy firm, leveraging real-world data to monitor, assess, and optimize financial performance.
The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the firm’s monthly financial activities, including revenue generation, operational and overhead costs, consultant fees, and marketing expenses. With key metrics such as Net Profit, Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses, and Forecasted Revenue, this project aims to deliver meaningful insights into the company’s financial health.
Through tools like Power BI and Google Sheets, interns will clean, analyze, and visualize financial data to identify patterns, highlight discrepancies, and uncover areas for cost optimization or strategic investment. The project will also involve making data-driven budgeting recommendations to enhance forecasting accuracy and financial planning.
This hands-on financial analysis project not only aids in understanding a consultancy firm’s economic landscape but also cultivates essential skills in data handling, visualization, and strategic financial decision-making.

## Problem Statement

Consultancy firms often operate in dynamic environments, managing multiple projects with varying cost structures and revenue streams. However, without effective financial monitoring and budgeting strategies, these firms risk overspending, underestimating revenue potentials, and misallocating resources.
The primary challenge addressed in this project is the lack of a centralized, data-driven approach to track and analyze monthly financial performance. Key financial indicators such as revenue, operational and overhead costs, net profit, and expense variance are often recorded but not systematically evaluated for strategic decision-making.
This project seeks to solve this problem by utilizing historical financial data to build an interactive financial analysis and budgeting dashboard. The aim is to provide clear visibility into the firm’s financial health, enable comparison between forecasted and actual results, and offer actionable recommendations for improving budget accuracy, minimizing costs, and enhancing profitability.

## Project Objective

## DATA TRANSFORMATION

The dataset was thoroughly cleaned and transformed to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability. This included handling missing values, standardizing formats, resolving inconsistencies, and creating new conditional columns to enhance analytical depth and support effective modeling.

## Data Modeling and relationships

The data model was built in Power BI to ensure an efficient and accurate analysis. Key aspects of the data modeling include:
1. Tables and Relationships: Creating of tables such as feedback ID, Project ID, Project Type and time periods. Relationships were established between these tables to link data points appropriately (e.g., linking projects table with the fact table via the project ID).
2.	Calculated Columns: Added calculated columns for deeper analysis, such as:
- Profit margin
- Total Budget
3.	Measures: Developed key metrics for performance analysis, including:
  - Total Revenue
  - Total Net Profit
  -	Product Performance; These measures were created using DAX (Data 
Analysis Expressions) formulas for dynamic reporting.
4.	Date Table: A date table was created to enable time-based analysis and comparisons.

 ## Recommendations
 
1.	Prioritize Investment in High-Performing Areas (Marketing and Research):
The analysis indicates that Marketing and Research projects yield the highest profit margins and contribute significantly to overall revenue. Continued investment in these areas can drive growth, improve brand visibility, and enhance long-term profitability. Strategic resource allocation to these departments should be considered a priority.
2.	Investigate Operational Cost Anomalies:
Unusually high operational costs in certain project categories—particularly where costs appear disproportionately high or unaccounted for—should be investigated thoroughly. Identifying the root causes of these anomalies will help in eliminating inefficiencies, preventing budget overruns, and ensuring accurate financial reporting.
3.	Reallocate Budget for Optimal Return on Investment (ROI):
Budget allocations should be re-evaluated to align with performance outcomes. Redirecting funds from underperforming or low-yield areas to high-impact initiatives can maximize ROI. This includes optimizing marketing spend, adjusting consultant fees, and cutting non-essential miscellaneous expenses.
4.	Closely Monitor Underperforming Segments (e.g., IT Consulting):
Departments like IT Consulting, which show lower profit margins or higher-than-expected expenses, should be closely reviewed. Performance metrics must be tracked regularly, and corrective actions—such as revising project scopes or improving cost controls—should be implemented to improve efficiency and viability.
